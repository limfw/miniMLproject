# Mini ML Project Hub

Welcome to my personal repository of **mini machine learning projects**, each crafted to demonstrate ML applications, clean architecture, and practical deployment.

Each project is self-contained, with its own code, models, and README instructions. They are shared for **public learning and feedback**.

## Project Goals

- Build modular and practical ML mini-projects
- Emphasize clean coding and reproducibility
- Share explainable models with simple visualizations
- Deploy via **GitHub Pages**

---

## How to Use

Each project contains:
- Its own `README.md` with setup and usage instructions
- A `requirements.txt` file to install dependencies
- Code organized into folders: `Code/`, `Model/`, `Data/`, `App/`, etc.

### Example Setup

```bash
cd Fake-job-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/text_model.py
